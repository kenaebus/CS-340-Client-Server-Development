## How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

What was essential when writing programs is to be aware of scalability and how the foundations of programs are the most important for the final project to be executed successfully. Simplicity was essential when I was working on the CRUD Python module. It was important to send and retrieve data for the main functionality between the dashboard widgets and the database.
What made the module adaptable is its simplicity, it's easier to transfer it to other applications of the same functionality and use. It can be reused and scaled for other applications' functionality. 

## How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

Approaching this problem as a computer scientist is thinking through the needed functionalities for the final product. Just have an idea but not the final code for it. Working through the requirements section by section and ensuring that it is at utmost simplicity and efficiency will aid in the long run, especially when displaying data using the widgets. It's important to have the main functionalities working as opposed to non-essential. An example can be the database and CRUD. Dashboard widgets were important but didn't have priority compared to previous functionality. Dashboard widgets were useless if they didn't have anything to display.


## What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists work to solve problems and solve all types of problems. Solving problems isn't simple, it goes in-depth to find efficient and reliable solutions and for these solutions to be up-to-date and last. Staying up-to-date with the latest software and applications trends with time and new technologies that can solve prior solutions. It helps businesses and companies to solve a problem, to make a process simpler objectives, to help themselves or clients, to satisfy. Grazioso Salvare needed a record of thousands of animals, to be grouped/sorted/organized, in order to get direct data and answers for their business.
